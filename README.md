## What is the Roblox Lua Obfuscator?

A Closed Source, Roblox Lua Script Obfuscator so you can keep your code from being cracked and people stealing the source code.

**ONLY THE RELEASE VERSION WORKS AT THE MOMENT**

## Common Issue's

When it is installing it's modules and dll's, do **NOT** forcefully close it from running in the background, it was made to be that way to look better.

Make sure the lua script **isn't** already obfuscated or it will error.

### Roblox Lua Obfuscator Features

- Auto Obfuscate (When it see's a lua script finished, it will auto obfuscate it and copy it to the clipboard, this can be toggled)
- Deobfuscation with a key system (When someone try's to Deobfuscate your script, they will need a key that you made to do so)
- Script manipulation (Can make a script look normal and look fine, but you can add hidden stuff)
- Blacklist System (it can add a blakclist system to your scripts)

## YES THIS WAS MADE IN JAVASCRIPT, BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM!
